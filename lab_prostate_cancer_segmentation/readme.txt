The main idea of each IPYNB:

main_pre_procedure.ipynb:
The processes before implementation of classifiers, including the procedure of outlier detection and training set selection.

NN_test_with_kFold.ipynb:
Train data with NN classifier with the functions in NN_function_with_kFold.py
Have a test on the validation data set and plot the prediction.

kNN_test_with_kFold.ipynb:
Not train to get a final result, just for having a general idea. 

kNN_test_with_kFold_2.ipynb:
Train data with kNN classifier with the functions in kNN_function_with_kFold.py

SVC_test_with_kFold.ipynb:
Train data with SVC classifier with the functions in SVC_function_with_kFold.py

Validation(kNN and SVM).ipynb:
Have a test on the validation data set with the parameters got in the training stage for kNN and SVM classifiers.
Plot the prediction of them.  

kNN training (with those labeled differently by experts are regarded as label 2).ipynb:
Try to improve the results of kNN.
The data which are labeled differently by experts are all regarded as cancer data.
However, the result hasn't been improved.

Feature_Selection_Filter.ipynb:
chi-square filter approach to choose feature and plot the two features in the feature space.

NN_feature_selection_with_kFold.ipynb:
nn feature selection by wrap approach
have a test on the validation data set as well as plot the predictation.

kNN_feature_selection_with_kFold.ipynb:
kNN feature selection by wrap approach and choose the min BER parameter one
have a test on the validation data set as well as plot the predictation.

Ensemble_modeling.ipynb:
train the model by stacking and bagging, and validation
